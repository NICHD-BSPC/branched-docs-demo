<ul>
  <li><strong>In-person lecture and hands on demonstrations</strong>: Tuesdays, 10am-12pm starting January 28th</li>
  <li><strong>In-person practice sessions</strong>: Fridays at 10am-12pm starting on January 31st
    <ul>
      <li>This is a chance to review material from Tuesday and work on the weekly assignments (see below) with help from Dr. Chang, BSPC staff as well as fellow students. You are strongly encouraged to attend these sessions to get the most out of this course.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous Practice</strong>: 3-4 hours of asynchronous practice and reading. This will prepare you for the following week and allow you to apply knowledge to new examples. You will submit small weekly assignment to me so I can check your progress and adjust content if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Links to weekly lessons will be provided several days in advance of when they will be covered in the course. All course materials are living documents - some changes may be made after publishing to reflect our progress through the material.</p>

<h3 id="submission-of-assignments">Submission of assignments</h3>

<p>In certain asynchronous lessons, there are Assignment sections noted. For weeks 1-4, please let me (Dr. Chang) know via private Slack message when you are done with each of them. Due to their permissions settings, I can view files inside of your individual Biowulf course directories, making it unecessary for you to “submit” work in the traditional sense.</p>
